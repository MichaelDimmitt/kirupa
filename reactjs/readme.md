Big fan of Kirupa's lifecycle methods example. 

rights for the current code. belong to kirupa. In addition I will put in a few details I have learned over time. 

this repository is being used for self education purposes. and self reference.

Okay, I just deleted everything else. that wasnt lifecycle methods.
But going to put some of my front end javascript examples here.
anything not lifecycle method is as of now coming from
